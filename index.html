            Some journeys can be summed up in a photo, a tweet, a souvenir. But
            others are so filled with inner riches, they defy easy description.
            For our guests, this has always posed a challenge: How to best
            capture the world of luxury that is The Leela? For one visitor, it’s
            a lobby – and a welcome that makes her feel like royalty. For
            another, it’s discovering a hidden garden, guided only by the scent
            of jasmine. To some, it is small touches that few others notice –
            the warmth of a gesture, the extra care in the simplest dish.
            Finding the right words for this distinctly Indian brand of luxury
            is made all the more difficult because it is constantly being
            refined and enhanced by each person we invite to join our staff.

            From the start, we have been on a continuous journey to delight each
            traveller who crosses our threshold. It is The Leela’s goal to
            provide the most demanding guests with memorable, magical stays that
            deliver the essence of India and discover a 5-Star experience found
            only in India, and only at The Leela. In a span of 30 years, The
            Leela Palaces, Hotels and Resorts has grown to comprise a
            world-class collection of nine award-winning luxury hotels spread
            across key destinations in India with many more on the anvil.
